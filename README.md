# KeyedCeaserCipher
This program encrypts and decrypts a message using a keyed ceaser cipher. The user will input the password to create the cipher. 

This is a basic python program. This program will brush up on my python syntax.


Future Plans:
Attempt to decipher messages without the password. 
	Search for one letter words(A&I) 
		OR
	Neural Network?
